this only works into ubuntu because in windows I cant find any working glut library for python 
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install glob3
pip3 install PyOpenGL
pip3 install PyOpenGL_accelerate"if cant run than try to add sudo before pip3


first-add this  "pip3 install Cmake"
after-you can add this  "pip3 install dlib"if error still occured than use stack overflow for solution

sudo apt-get install -y freeglut3-dev

next do this
sudo nano /etc/environment
this will open one file
Add this new line in that file and dont change any previous context
QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1
